## Hush Hush Clubhouse

A member only secret clubhouse where members can write embarrassing posts about non-members.
In the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and keep wondering who wrote it. Everything is hush hush. To be part of the members you must sign up.
